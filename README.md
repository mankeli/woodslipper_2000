WoodSlipper 2000
================

Simple program to insert various size rectangles optimally into a bigger rectangular area.
The program outputs a G-code to be used with a Morbidelli CNC-machine.
Also features a simple OpenGL visualization during the process.

This program was created to help my brother at work.
